## GitHub Organization Projects

This page provides an index of ongoing research projects in the McPherson Lab. Our projects are organized through our [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/McPhersonLab) where we collaborate on research initiatives related to conferences, journal publications, and grant applications.

### Project Repository Structure

Our research projects are categorized and tracked through GitHub repositories and project boards:

- **[Template Project Repository](https://github.com/mcphersonlab/template)**: Starting template for new research projects
- **[CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy)](https://credit.niso.org/)**: Standard for identifying contributions to research outputs
- **Conference Abstracts**: Research and abstracts for upcoming conferences
- **Manuscripts in Preparation**: Manuscripts in preparation for journal submissions
- **Grant Projects**: Grant proposals and collaborative research initiatives
- **Methods Development**: Novel computational and analytical methods
- **Data Analysis**: Ongoing data analysis and visualization projects

### How to Connect Projects

Each conference and call for papers entry in our [Research page](index.qmd) can be linked to:

1. **GitHub Repository**: A specific repository containing project code, data, and documentation
2. **GitHub Project Board**: A project board tracking tasks and milestones
3. **GitHub Issues**: Specific issues for abstract submissions, paper drafts, or collaborative work

### Current Active Projects

Visit our [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/McPhersonLab) to see all active repositories and project boards. Projects are typically organized by:

- Conference name and year (e.g., `idweek-2025`)
- Journal and topic (e.g., `nature-amr-methods`)
- Research theme (e.g., `microbiome-ai`, `amr-genomics`)
