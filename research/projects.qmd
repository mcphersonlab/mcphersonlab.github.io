## GitHub Organization Projects

This page provides a comprehensive index of ongoing research projects in the McPherson Lab. Our projects are organized through our [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/McPhersonLab) where we collaborate on research initiatives related to conferences, journal publications, and grant applications.

### Quick Overview

We maintain **50+ active research projects** across multiple domains including:

- **Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)**: Genomic and clinical investigations of drug-resistant pathogens
- **Gut Microbiome**: Metagenomic and metabolomic analyses of human gut microbiota
- **Treatment Optimization**: Evidence-based approaches to infectious disease management
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Machine learning applications in microbiology and medicine
- **Biophysics & Pharmacology**: Molecular mechanisms and drug discovery
- **Health Economics**: Cost-effectiveness and ROI analyses
- **Environmental Health**: Climate change impacts on infectious diseases

All projects use standardized workflows, documentation templates, and CRediT contributor roles for transparent collaboration.

### Project Repository Structure

Our research projects are categorized and tracked through GitHub repositories and project boards:

- **[Template Project Repository](https://github.com/mcphersonlab/template)**: Starting template for new research projects
- **[CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy)](https://credit.niso.org/)**: Standard for identifying contributions to research outputs
- **Conference Abstracts**: Research and abstracts for upcoming conferences
- **Manuscripts in Preparation**: Manuscripts in preparation for journal submissions
- **Grant Projects**: Grant proposals and collaborative research initiatives
- **Methods Development**: Novel computational and analytical methods
- **Data Analysis**: Ongoing data analysis and visualization projects

### How to Connect Projects

Each conference and call for papers entry in our [Research page](index.qmd) can be linked to:

1. **GitHub Repository**: A specific repository containing project code, data, and documentation
2. **GitHub Project Board**: A project board tracking tasks and milestones
3. **GitHub Issues**: Specific issues for abstract submissions, paper drafts, or collaborative work

**Project Workflow and Integration.** This diagram illustrates how research projects flow from initial concepts through GitHub repositories, conference presentations, and journal submissions. Projects are linked to specific calls for papers and conferences, with GitHub issues and project boards tracking progress at each stage.
