## GitHub Organization Projects

This page provides an index of ongoing research projects in the McPherson Lab. Our projects are organized through our [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/McPhersonLab) where we collaborate on research initiatives related to conferences, journal publications, and grant applications.

### Project Repository Structure

Our research projects are categorized and tracked through GitHub repositories and project boards:

- **Conference Projects**: Research and abstracts for upcoming conferences
- **Publication Projects**: Manuscripts in preparation for journal submissions
- **Grant Projects**: Grant proposals and collaborative research initiatives
- **Methods Development**: Novel computational and analytical methods
- **Data Analysis**: Ongoing data analysis and visualization projects

### How to Connect Projects

Each conference and call for papers entry in our [Research page](index.qmd) can be linked to:

1. **GitHub Repository**: A specific repository containing project code, data, and documentation
2. **GitHub Project Board**: A project board tracking tasks and milestones
3. **GitHub Issues**: Specific issues for abstract submissions, paper drafts, or collaborative work

### Current Active Projects

Visit our [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/McPhersonLab) to see all active repositories and project boards. Projects are typically organized by:

- Conference name and year (e.g., `idweek-2025`)
- Journal and topic (e.g., `nature-amr-methods`)
- Research theme (e.g., `microbiome-ai`, `amr-genomics`)

### Contributing

Lab members can contribute to projects by:

1. Creating a new repository for a conference submission or paper
2. Adding the project to the relevant conference or call for papers entry
3. Using GitHub Issues and Projects to track progress
4. Collaborating through pull requests and code reviews
