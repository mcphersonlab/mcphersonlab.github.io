## Overview

Protocols.io is an open-access repository for science methods that enables researchers to share, discover, and discuss detailed experimental protocols. It provides a collaborative platform for protocol development with version control, making methods more reproducible and accessible.

## Key Features

- **Step-by-Step Protocols**: Detailed experimental procedures with materials, equipment, and timing
- **Version Control**: Track changes and improvements to protocols over time
- **Collaborative Editing**: Work with team members to develop and refine protocols
- **Protocol Collections**: Organize related protocols into workflows
- **Rich Media Support**: Include images, videos, and interactive elements
- **DOI Assignment**: Make protocols citable with unique identifiers
- **Integration**: Connect protocols to publications and data repositories

## Use Cases in Research

- Sharing detailed experimental methods with collaborators
- Publishing reproducible protocols alongside papers
- Finding validated protocols for specific techniques
- Documenting and standardizing lab procedures
- Training new lab members with consistent methods
- Ensuring method reproducibility across studies
