## Overview

The National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) is a collaboration among the CDC, FDA, USDA, and state and local public health departments to monitor antimicrobial resistance in foodborne and other enteric bacteria from humans, retail meats, and food animals. NARMS has been tracking resistance trends since 1996.

## Key Features

- **One Health Approach**: Integrates human, animal, and food data
- **Long-Term Surveillance**: Over 25 years of resistance data
- **Foodborne Pathogens**: Focus on Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli, and Enterococcus
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data for multiple antimicrobials
- **Public Data Access**: Annual reports and online data query systems
- **Genomic Surveillance**: Whole genome sequencing of isolates

## Use Cases in Research

- Foodborne antimicrobial resistance trends
- Association between agricultural antimicrobial use and human resistance
- Emergence and spread of resistance mechanisms
- Risk assessment for resistant foodborne infections
- Evaluation of interventions to reduce resistance
- Molecular epidemiology of enteric pathogens
