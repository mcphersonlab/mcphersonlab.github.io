The system provides critical data for infection control, antimicrobial stewardship, and public health policy.

## Key Features

- **Nationwide Coverage**: Data from all major healthcare institutions in Singapore
- **Integrated System**: Links to national infectious disease surveillance
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Timely detection of resistance trends
- **Quality Assurance**: Rigorous laboratory standards
- **Genomic Surveillance**: Whole genome sequencing capabilities
- **Regional Leadership**: Collaboration with ASEAN countries

## Use Cases in Research

- Singapore AMR trends and epidemiology
- Healthcare-associated infection surveillance
- Antimicrobial stewardship effectiveness
- Regional and international AMR comparisons
- Outbreak investigation and control
- Molecular epidemiology research
