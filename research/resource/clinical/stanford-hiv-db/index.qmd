## Overview

The Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database is a comprehensive resource for HIV drug resistance mutations and their impact on antiretroviral therapy. It provides genotypic resistance interpretation, surveillance data, and tools for analyzing HIV-1 sequence data. The database is curated by experts and widely used in clinical practice and research.

## Key Features

- **Resistance Interpretation**: HIVdb algorithm for genotypic resistance interpretation
- **Mutation Database**: Extensive collection of HIV drug resistance mutations
- **Sequence Analysis Tools**: Web-based tools for HIV sequence analysis and quality assessment
- **Surveillance Data**: Global HIV drug resistance surveillance data
- **Treatment Guidelines**: Links to major HIV treatment guidelines
- **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**: Data linking mutations to drug susceptibility

## Use Cases in Research

- HIV drug resistance surveillance and epidemiology
- Development and validation of resistance prediction algorithms
- Antiretroviral treatment failure analysis
- Evolution of resistance mutations
- Transmitted drug resistance studies
- Personalized HIV treatment strategies
