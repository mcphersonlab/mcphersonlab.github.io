## Overview

The Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (MORU) conducts extensive antimicrobial resistance research in Southeast Asia. MORU generates high-quality datasets combining clinical, microbiological, and genomic data to understand AMR epidemiology and inform treatment strategies for tropical infectious diseases.

## Key Features

- **Southeast Asian Focus**: Research across Thailand and neighboring countries
- **Multi-Disciplinary**: Integration of clinical, microbiological, and genomic data
- **Tropical Diseases**: Emphasis on malaria, typhoid, melioidosis, and other regional pathogens
- **Genomic Surveillance**: Whole genome sequencing of resistant isolates
- **Clinical Trials**: Linked to treatment efficacy studies
- **Open Science**: Commitment to data sharing and collaboration

## Use Cases in Research

- AMR in tropical infectious diseases
- Genomic epidemiology in Southeast Asia
- Treatment outcomes and resistance
- Drug development and resistance mechanisms
- Clinical trial design and analysis
- Public health intervention evaluation
