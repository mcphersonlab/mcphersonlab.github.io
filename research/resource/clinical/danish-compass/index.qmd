## Overview

The Danish microbiome cohorts, including the COMPASS (Cohort of Microbiome Profiling and Associated Screening Studies) initiative, represent large-scale population-based studies of the gut microbiome in Denmark. These cohorts integrate microbiome data with extensive health registry data, enabling powerful epidemiological research on microbiome-health associations.

## Key Features

- **Registry Linkage**: Connection to Danish national health registries
- **Population Scale**: Thousands of participants from general population
- **Longitudinal Design**: Follow-up data through health registries
- **Comprehensive Health Data**: Disease diagnoses, medications, and outcomes
- **High-Quality Sequencing**: Shotgun metagenomic data
- **Disease Focus**: Multiple disease areas including metabolic and inflammatory conditions

## Use Cases in Research

- Population-level microbiome epidemiology
- Disease risk prediction using microbiome
- Medication effects on microbiome composition
- Long-term health outcomes and microbiome
- Gene-environment interactions in microbiome
- Causal inference in microbiome research
