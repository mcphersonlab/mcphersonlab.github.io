## Overview

The HHS/FDA Antiviral Resistance Monitoring System (AVR) is a surveillance program that monitors the emergence and prevalence of antiviral drug resistance in clinically important viruses. This system supports public health decision-making regarding antiviral drug use and development, particularly for influenza and other respiratory viruses.

## Key Features

- **Viral Surveillance**: Focus on influenza and emerging respiratory viruses
- **Resistance Testing**: Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of resistance
- **Seasonal Monitoring**: Regular surveillance during influenza seasons
- **Geographic Coverage**: National and regional resistance patterns
- **Clinical Correlation**: Links resistance to clinical outcomes
- **Public Health Guidance**: Informs treatment recommendations and drug development

## Use Cases in Research

- Antiviral drug resistance trends and patterns
- Emergence of novel resistance mutations
- Clinical impact of antiviral resistance
- Predictive modeling of resistance spread
- Evaluation of antiviral stewardship strategies
- Drug development and resistance mechanism studies

## Getting Started

Visit the [FDA website](https://www.fda.gov/) to access surveillance reports and learn about the antiviral resistance monitoring program.
