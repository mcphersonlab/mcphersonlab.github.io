## Overview

Lifelines DEEP is a multi-omics sub-study within the Lifelines biobank cohort from the Netherlands. It integrates gut microbiome data with host genetics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and extensive phenotypic information from over 1,500 Dutch individuals, creating one of the most comprehensive datasets linking microbiome to health.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Omics Integration**: Metagenomics, host genetics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics
- **Well-Characterized Cohort**: Detailed health, dietary, and lifestyle data
- **Population-Based**: Representative of the northern Netherlands
- **Systems Biology Resource**: Enables integrative analyses
- **Quality Data**: Rigorous quality control and standardized protocols
- **Open Access**: Data available for research collaboration

## Use Cases in Research

- Genome-wide association studies of microbiome traits
- Multi-omics integration and network analysis
- Diet, microbiome, and metabolic health
- Host genetic control of microbiome composition
- Disease biomarker discovery
- Personalized nutrition research
