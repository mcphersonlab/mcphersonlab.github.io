## Overview

The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) was a landmark NIH initiative to characterize the microbial communities that inhabit the human body and their role in human health and disease. HMP1 focused on establishing a baseline understanding of the healthy human microbiome across multiple body sites in a large cohort of healthy adults.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Site Sampling**: 15-18 body sites per individual
- **Large Cohort**: 242 healthy adults (ages 18-40)
- **Comprehensive Sequencing**: 16S rRNA and whole genome shotgun metagenomic data
- **Reference Genomes**: Over 900 reference microbial genomes
- **Longitudinal Data**: Multiple timepoints for stability analysis
- **Public Data**: All data freely available through the HMP Data Portal

## Use Cases in Research

- Normal human microbiome composition and variation
- Development of microbiome analysis methods
- Comparative microbiome studies across body sites
- Baseline for disease microbiome comparisons
- Microbial community assembly and stability
- Host-microbiome interactions

## Getting Started

Visit the [HMP Data Portal](https://hmpdacc.org/) to access sequence data, metadata, and reference genomes.
