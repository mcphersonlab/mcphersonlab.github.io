## Overview

The American Gut Project (AGP) is one of the largest crowdsourced citizen science microbiome projects, collecting fecal, skin, and oral samples from thousands of participants across the United States and internationally. Combined with self-reported health and lifestyle data, AGP provides a unique resource for understanding microbiome diversity in the general population.

## Key Features

- **Citizen Science**: Participant-driven sample collection and data contribution
- **Large Scale**: Over 10,000 participants from diverse backgrounds
- **Multiple Body Sites**: Gut, skin, and oral microbiome samples
- **Self-Reported Data**: Diet, lifestyle, health, and medication information
- **16S rRNA Sequencing**: Comprehensive taxonomic profiling
- **Public Data**: All data openly available for research

## Use Cases in Research

- Population-level microbiome diversity and variation
- Diet and lifestyle associations with microbiome
- Geographic and demographic patterns in microbiome
- Antibiotic effects on microbiome composition
- Comparative microbiome across body sites
- Citizen science methodology research
