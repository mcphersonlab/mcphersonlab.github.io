## Overview

The National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) Japan maintains clinical whole genome sequencing (WGS) datasets for various pathogens of public health importance. NIID conducts genomic surveillance to track pathogen evolution, antimicrobial resistance, and outbreak investigations across Japan.

## Key Features

- **Genomic Surveillance**: Whole genome sequencing of clinical isolates
- **Diverse Pathogens**: Coverage of bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens
- **AMR Focus**: Detailed characterization of resistance mechanisms
- **Outbreak Investigation**: Real-time genomic epidemiology
- **Public Health Integration**: Links to Japanese disease surveillance systems
- **International Collaboration**: Contributions to global pathogen databases

## Use Cases in Research

- Pathogen genomic epidemiology in Japan
- Evolution and transmission of antimicrobial resistance
- Outbreak source tracking and investigation
- Molecular typing and strain characterization
- Comparative genomics and phylogenetics
- Vaccine and diagnostic development
