## Overview

The European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) collects and analyzes antimicrobial resistance data from clinical laboratories across Europe. Operating since 1999 and coordinated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), EARS-Net provides standardized, validated data on resistance patterns in invasive bacterial infections.

## Key Features

- **European Coverage**: Data from all EU/EEA countries
- **Long-Term Trends**: Over 20 years of surveillance data
- **Invasive Infections**: Focus on bloodstream and CSF isolates
- **Priority Pathogens**: Eight bacterial species of public health importance
- **Standardized Methods**: Harmonized protocols and quality assurance
- **Public Data Portal**: Interactive database for data exploration

## Use Cases in Research

- European antimicrobial resistance trends and patterns
- International comparison of resistance epidemiology
- Early detection of emerging resistance threats
- Impact evaluation of national action plans
- Burden of AMR estimation
- Healthcare-associated infection research

## Getting Started
