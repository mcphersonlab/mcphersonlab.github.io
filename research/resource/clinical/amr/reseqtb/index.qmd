## Overview

The Relational Sequencing Tuberculosis (ReSeqTB) Platform is a data-sharing and analysis resource for tuberculosis genomics and drug resistance. Supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, ReSeqTB provides a centralized repository of Mycobacterium tuberculosis whole genome sequences linked to detailed phenotypic drug susceptibility testing results.

## Key Features

- **Genomic Repository**: Thousands of M. tuberculosis whole genome sequences
- **Phenotypic Data**: Comprehensive drug susceptibility testing results
- **Data Integration**: Links genotypes to phenotypes for resistance prediction
- **Analysis Tools**: Web-based tools for sequence analysis and variant calling
- **Global Coverage**: Isolates from diverse geographic regions
- **Open Access**: Data available to registered researchers

## Use Cases in Research

- Tuberculosis drug resistance genomics
- Development of molecular diagnostics for TB resistance
- Discovery of novel resistance mechanisms
- Epidemiology of drug-resistant TB
- Machine learning for resistance prediction
- Clinical decision support tool development

## Getting Started

Visit the [ReSeqTB Platform](https://platform.reseqtb.org/) to register and access genomic and phenotypic data.
