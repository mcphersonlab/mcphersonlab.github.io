## Overview

The Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) maintains extensive whole genome sequencing datasets for antimicrobial resistance research. As one of the world's largest genomics organizations, BGI generates comprehensive pathogen genomics data supporting AMR surveillance, outbreak investigation, and resistance mechanism discovery.

## Key Features

- **Large-Scale Sequencing**: High-throughput whole genome sequencing capacity
- **Diverse Pathogen Coverage**: Bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens
- **AMR Genomics**: Focus on resistance gene identification and characterization
- **Clinical Integration**: Links to clinical and epidemiological data
- **Global Collaboration**: International research partnerships
- **Advanced Bioinformatics**: Sophisticated analysis pipelines

## Use Cases in Research

- Antimicrobial resistance genomics and mechanisms
- Pathogen evolution and transmission dynamics
- Outbreak investigation and source attribution
- Comparative genomics across geographic regions
- Novel resistance gene discovery
- Diagnostic and therapeutic target identification
