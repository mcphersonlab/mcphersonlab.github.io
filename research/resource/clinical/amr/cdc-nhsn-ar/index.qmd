## Overview

The National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Antimicrobial Resistance (AR) Option is CDC's system for tracking antimicrobial resistance in healthcare settings across the United States. It provides facility-level and national data on multidrug-resistant organisms and resistance trends, supporting efforts to prevent and control healthcare-associated infections.

## Key Features

- **Healthcare Facility Data**: Resistance data from thousands of U.S. hospitals
- **Standardized Definitions**: Consistent criteria for resistant organisms
- **Priority Pathogens**: Focus on MDRO and CDC priority organisms
- **Benchmarking**: Facility-level comparisons to national data
- **Public Reporting**: Aggregate data available through CDC portals
- **Real-Time Surveillance**: Regular updates from participating facilities

## Use Cases in Research

- Healthcare-associated antimicrobial resistance trends
- Facility-level infection prevention effectiveness
- Geographic variation in resistance patterns
- Impact of stewardship and prevention interventions
- Burden of multidrug-resistant infections
- Risk factor analysis for resistant infections
