## Overview

The Singapore Sequencing Consortium, supported by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), generates comprehensive genomic datasets for pathogen surveillance and antimicrobial resistance research. The consortium combines cutting-edge sequencing technology with computational biology to advance infectious disease research in Singapore and Asia.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Genomics**: State-of-the-art sequencing and bioinformatics infrastructure
- **Pathogen Diversity**: Comprehensive coverage of clinical and environmental pathogens
- **AMR Genomics**: Detailed characterization of resistance mechanisms
- **Integration**: Links to clinical and epidemiological data
- **Innovation**: Development of novel analytical approaches
- **Regional Hub**: Support for Southeast Asian genomics initiatives

## Use Cases in Research

- Pathogen whole genome sequencing and analysis
- Antimicrobial resistance genomics
- Outbreak investigation and phylogenomics
- Evolution and transmission of pathogens
- Development of genomic surveillance tools
- Precision medicine for infectious diseases
