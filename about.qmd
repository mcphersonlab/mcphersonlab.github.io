## Our Approach

We are a [**pharmacology**]((https://mcphersonlab.github.io/research/#research-areas)) that uses [**cloud computing** and **artificial intelligence**](https://mcphersonlab.github.io/research/#research-areas) for drug discovery, research and development of anti-infective agents for the treatment and elimination of [**infectious diseases**](https://mcphersonlab.github.io/research/#research-areas) that benefits the lives of people today and generations tomorrow.

Ongoing projects can be found at the Lab [**GitHub**](https://github.com/McPhersonLab/projects). 

## Research Philosophy

We believe in:

- **Open Science**: Making our research accessible and reproducible on our [**GitHub**](https://github.com/McPhersonLab) and [**Zenodo**](https://zenodo.org/communities/mcphersonlab)
- **Collaboration**: Working across disciplines to tackle complex problems: [**OverLeaf**](https://www.overleaf.com/) and [**Zotero**](https://www.zotero.org/groups/6318889/mcphersonlab/library)
- **Innovation**: Developing new methods and approaches
- **Excellence**: Maintaining the highest standards in our research by publishing in [highly reputable journals](https://mcphersonlab.github.io/research/#pubmed-literature-search-builder)
