## Research Philosophy

We believe in:

- **Purpose**: The vision of a world without infectious diseases 🦠
- **Passion**: The thrill of exploring the world through science conferences🌎
- **Innovation**: Classically trained pharmacologists that are highly enthusiastic about new technologies 🤖


## Our Approach

We are a [**pharmacology**](https://mcphersonlab.github.io/research/area/pharmacology/) lab that integrates [**artificial intelligence**](https://mcphersonlab.github.io/research/area/artificial-intelligence/) with laboratory data for [drug discovery and development](https://mcphersonlab.github.io/research/area/drug-development/) and other [areas of research](https://mcphersonlab.github.io/research). [Ongoing projects](https://mcphersonlab.github.io/research/projects) are at the  [**Lab GitHub**](https://github.com/mcphersonlab), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/mcphersonlab) or listed under [publications](https://mcphersonlab.github.io/publications/)

Our research is driven by three pillars:

1. **More data**

2. **Better analyses**

3. **Data visualization**

## Our GitHub-Centered Workflow
