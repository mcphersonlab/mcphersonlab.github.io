## Research Philosophy

We believe in:

- **Open Science**: Making our research accessible and reproducible on our [**GitHub**](https://github.com/McPhersonLab) and [**Zenodo**](https://zenodo.org/communities/mcphersonlab)
- **Collaboration**: Working across disciplines to tackle complex problems: [**OverLeaf**](https://www.overleaf.com/) and [**Zotero**](https://www.zotero.org/groups/6318889/mcphersonlab/library)
- **Innovation**: Developing new methods and approaches
- **Excellence**: Maintaining the highest standards in our research by publishing in [highly reputable journals](https://mcphersonlab.github.io/research/#pubmed-literature-search-builder)


## Our Approach

We are a [**pharmacology**](https://mcphersonlab.github.io/research/area/pharmacology/) that uses [**artificial intelligence**](https://mcphersonlab.github.io/research/area/artificial-intelligence/) for [drug discovery](https://mcphersonlab.github.io/research/area/drug-development/), research and development for the treatment and elimination of [**infectious diseases**](https://mcphersonlab.github.io/research/#research-areas) that benefits the lives of people today and generations tomorrow.

There is a vast wealth of publicly available, high-quality [genomic](https://mcphersonlab.github.io/research/area/genomics/), [clinical](https://mcphersonlab.github.io/research/area/pharmacy/) and biological data - yet, their curation, analysis and visualization are generally lacking. Can the analyses of the pharmacologist, specifically that of **Schild regression** of *Receptor Theory*, extend beyond the bench to the bedside and the real-world? We believe - **yes**. 

1. **More data**

2. **Better analyses**

3. **Data visualization**
