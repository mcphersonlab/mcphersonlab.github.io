## Research Philosophy

We believe in:

- **Open Science**: Making our research accessible and reproducible on our [**GitHub**](https://github.com/McPhersonLab) and [**Zenodo**](https://zenodo.org/communities/mcphersonlab)
- **Collaboration**: Working across disciplines to tackle complex problems: [**OverLeaf**](https://www.overleaf.com/) and [**Zotero**](https://www.zotero.org/groups/6318889/mcphersonlab/library)
- **Innovation**: Developing new methods and approaches
- **Excellence**: Maintaining the highest standards in our research by publishing in [highly reputable journals](https://mcphersonlab.github.io/research/#pubmed-literature-search-builder)


## Our Approach

We are a [**pharmacology**](https://mcphersonlab.github.io/research/area/pharmacology/) that uses [**artificial intelligence**](https://mcphersonlab.github.io/research/area/artificial-intelligence/) for [drug discovery and development](https://mcphersonlab.github.io/research/area/drug-development/) and other [areas of research](https://mcphersonlab.github.io/research)

Our ongoing projects and publications can be found at the Lab [**GitHub**](https://github.com/mcphersonlab), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/mcphersonlab) and [publications](https://mcphersonlab.github.io/publications/)

We use: 

1. **More data**

2. **Better analyses**

3. **Data visualization**
