# Welcome to Your Book Title

This is the index page to an example book template:  [https://github.com/JacobKMcPherson/template_quarto_book_minimal](https://github.com/JacobKMcPherson/template_quarto_book_minimal). You can use this template to create your own textbook or academic book using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). 


You can add chapters and sections by creating additional `.qmd` files in the same directory or subdirectories. Each chapter can be structured with headings, text, images, code blocks, and other elements supported by Quarto.

Make sure to explore Quarto's documentation for more advanced features like citations, cross-references, and custom styling to enhance your book's presentation.

Happy Writing!
